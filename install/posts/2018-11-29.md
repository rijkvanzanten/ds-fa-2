# Performance Budgeting

**If you’re building a web experience and want to stay fast, a [performance budget](https://timkadlec.com/2013/01/setting-a-performance-budget/) can be critical. For success, embrace performance budgets and learn to live within them. Network & CPU limits on mobile can require asking hard questions like, “what is really important to my users?”**

When we talk to Fortune 500 companies that put in the work to improve performance, perf metrics will often **rapidly regress** once they return to feature development. Performance budgets help teams prioritize features, optimizations and [facilitate](https://tobias.is/blogging/web-performance-budgets-as-currency/) discussions on what is really important to users.
