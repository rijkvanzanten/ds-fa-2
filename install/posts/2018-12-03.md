**navigator.connection.effectiveType is useful for delivering different assets based on the quality of the user's network connection.**

[effectiveType](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NetworkInformation/effectiveType) is a property of the [Network Information API](http://w3c.github.io/netinfo/), exposed to JavaScript via the [navigator.connection](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/connection) object. In Chrome, you can drop the following into DevTools to see your effective connection type (ECT):

```js
console.log(navigator.connection.effectiveType); // 4G
```

Possible values for `effectiveType` are 'slow-2g', '2g', '3g', or '4g'. On slow connections this capability allows you to improve how quickly pages load by serving lower-quality versions of resources.
