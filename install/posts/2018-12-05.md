# Flocking

**Have you ever watched a school of fish, a flock of birds, or even a crowd of people and watched how they move?**

Moving together, yet without a leader, they are exhibiting a behavior known as flocking.

Programmer Craig Reynolds defined this behavior according to three rules:

1. Separation - Members will steer to maintain a defined distance from one another
2. Alignment - Members will steer to face in a similar direction as members around them
3. Cohesion - Members will steer to remain close to the flock

We can create flocking behavior in code by using these same rules.
