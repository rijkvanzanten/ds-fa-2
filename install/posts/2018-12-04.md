Practical approaches to Universal Design for making your website/webapp accessible to everyone.

## Use semantic HTML
Semantic HTML helps screenreader users to understand the contents structure and gives it meaning. Ask yourself "What is it?" when writing HTML. Use a **logical headline order** and structuring elements as **header, footer, ul, p** â€¦

## Provide text for non-text content
Every content not represented by text is invisbible for screen readers. Provide **concise descriptions in alt attributes** for all content images and text alternatives for charts etc. CAPTCHAs also need to be accessible.
