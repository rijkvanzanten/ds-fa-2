# Progressive Disclosure with CSS

Recently we were lucky enough to read here at SiloCreativo a great article by **Félix Ortega** about UX entitled “[Progressive Disclosure: Looking for the Simple in the Complex](https://www.silocreativo.com/en/progressive-disclosure-looking-for-the-simple-inside-the-complex/)“ with good real examples to better understand this technique of progressive disclosure and how to apply it to our work.

In web design we can find many points where **applying this technique would mean an improvement in the User Experience**, but perhaps the example that comes first are the forms, those points where the user acts directly with the application.
