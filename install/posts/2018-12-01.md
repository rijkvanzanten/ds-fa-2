# Redesigning your product and website for dark mode

If, on the off chance:

* You’re reading this entry using Safari Technology Preview 68, and
* You’ve already upgraded your MacOS to Mojave 10.14, and
* You’ve selected Dark appearance in System Preferences

You’ll have noticed that I’ve implemented a brand new dark mode version of my website.
